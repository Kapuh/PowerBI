-- My user agent -- 

Set My user agent (headers = {"User-Agent" : "Paste from google"}), because some sites block the user if you don't have it. E.g. Amazon.
You can get user agent information by writing my user agent to google search.

-- Connection testing --

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# get User-Agent from chrome with my user agent.
headers = {"User-Agent":""}

# set url you are going to use.
url = ""
r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# test connection. 200 means it's working. Something else depends about code what is happening.
print(r.status_code)
